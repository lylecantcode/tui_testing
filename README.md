# New Project To Test TUIs Using Bubbletea

This is my first TUI based project.

I used a basis from the basic shopping list example.  
To this I added the ability to insert/delete items as well as database integration.  
This involved a lot of customisation and experimentation.


Potential future upgrades would be via the use of 'Lipgloss' to stylise the TUI and potentially input validation.

Additionally, maybe evolving the concept into something with more utility.
